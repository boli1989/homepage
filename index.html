	<p>
		I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Computer Science at University of Oxford, hosted by Edith Elkind. 
		Before that, I received my PhD in 2019 from the Department of Computer Science at Stony Brook University, under the supervision of Jing Chen. 
		I completed my B.S. in Applied Maths and M.S. in Operations Research at Ocean University of China, under the supervision of Qizhi Fang.
